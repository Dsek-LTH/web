When you arrive in Lund as a newly admitted student, you'll be bombarded with new impressions, people, places, and all sorts of strange things almost daily. To make this experience as smooth and fun as possible, you, as a n0lla, will go through an initiation period called “nollning.” Nollning is one of the most enjoyable aspects of student life and will provide you with a great introduction to your new home. It's also the perfect opportunity to get to know many new friends, both fellow new students and senior students.<br/><br/>The schedule will be packed with fun activities, parties, and craziness. Nollning might therefore feel a bit intense. However, this is no problem as you have complete control over how much you want to participate in! We do recommend taking part as much as possible because nollning is just so incredibly fun!<br/><br/>Here you’ll find lots of useful information, and if you still have any questions about nollning, your studies, or life in Lund, feel free to ask the phaddrar and peppare!",

Sent from the gates where time stands still and peace is never broken, they now walk among n0llan. Their mission is to ignite flames in the darkness, to carry the light of hope through the trials of the n0llning, and to watch over every n0lla as they take their first steps into the new unkown. The n0lla will be guided on a journey filled with joy, friendship, and adventure.
